            Young adults in Norway are increasingly facing difficulties entering the housing market. Buying a first home or securing affordable rental housing has become more challenging due to rising prices and stricter lending requirements.
        </p>

            Housing costs have risen significantly. In 2023, around 21% of Norwegian households spent 40% or more of their income on housing 
            (<a href="https://www.ssb.no" target="_blank">SSB</a>). In urban areas like Oslo and Østfold, younger renters and low-income groups often spend over 30% of their disposable income on housing.

            Between 2015 and 2020, house prices increased by approximately 33–34%, far outpacing wage growth 
            (<a href="https://www.norges-bank.no/aktuelt/publikasjoner/Finansiell-stabilitet---rapport/finansiell-stabilitet-2019/innhold/" target="_blank">Norges Bank</a>). This makes it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to accumulate sufficient savings for a down payment.

        <p>
            In the Førstegangskjøperne 2025 Q1-report, NEF shows that the average size of first-time buyers’ homes has fallen in Oslo from 67 m² in 2008 to 61 m² in 2024 
            (<a href="https://nef.no/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Forstegangskjopere_2025Q1.pdf?" target="_blank">NEF</a>).

            Increasingly, young buyers rely on help from parents or co-buyers to access housing. This financial support has become a key factor in whether young adults can afford to buy a home.

            Supply constraints also make the market difficult. Industry observers note that fewer new units are being built in many urban areas, increasing pressure on both prices and availability 
            (<a href="https://www.deleiebolig.no/innsikt/ferske-tall-om-leieprisene-og-nyboligmarkedet" target="_blank">Deleiebolig.no</a>).

            According to Norway’s social housing strategy, approximately 179,000 people are disadvantaged in the housing market, including around 78,000 children and young people under the age of 20 
            (<a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/documents/we-all-need-a-safe-place-to-call-home-national-strategy-for-sosial-housing-policies-2021-2024/id2788470/" target="_blank">Regjeringen.no</a>).

            The government has introduced some measures to help young buyers. In 2025, the equity requirement for first-time buyers was reduced from 15% to 10% in certain cases, making it slightly easier to enter the market 
            (<a href="https://www.nordea.no/privat/ditt-liv/bolig/nye-boliglansregler-2025.html?" target="_blank">Nordea</a>).

    </div>

    <div class="scrollText">
        <p>
            Without structural changes in supply, affordability, and long-term policy, the gap between young Norwegians and homeownership may continue to grow, forcing many to rent longer, live with family, or compromise on housing quality and size.
